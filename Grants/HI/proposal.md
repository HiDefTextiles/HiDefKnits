# AI-Driven Textile Design: Process Optimization and Generative Patterns in Knitwear Manufacturing
Proposal for *University of Iceland Research fund*:
* Author: Dr. Helga Ingimundardóttir
* Date: 2023-10-23

## Abstract

Hand-knitting, deeply rooted in cultural traditions, is set to undergo a transformative revival through the
*AI-Driven Textile Design* project. While catering to the general public, it offers a standardized
platform for knitting terminologies and streamlining of design processes. By fusing disciplines such as
industrial engineering, computer science, and traditional textile design, this open-source initiative enables
even those unfamiliar with intricate knitting techniques to craft bespoke patterns. The incorporation of
generative AI in the program facilitates visualization and prototyping, allowing designs to be perfected
before realization. This project symbolizes a harmonious balance between cherishing cultural heritages and
harnessing modern technological advancements, all while aligning with Háskóli Íslands' vision for societal
enrichment through knowledge.

## Introduction


## Budget 2024-2026
The primary objective of our budget allocation is threefold. First, we aim to employ a Master's student during the 
summer months, offering them an opportunity for hands-on experience and meaningful contribution to this innovative 
project. This will not only further the project but also foster academic growth and skill enhancement for the 
student. Second, we anticipate setting up a fundamental web hosting service capable of running the beta version of 
our program. This infrastructure will serve as the foundation for our application, ensuring users can access and 
benefit from our service. Lastly, we have also provisioned for any licensing fees that might be incurred, 
particularly related to the integration of external software tools like DALL·E and Midjourney. This holistic 
approach ensures smooth operations, continuous development, and user satisfaction, all within a well-defined budget 
framework.


1. **Master's Student Internship** (Summer):
    * Duration: 3 months each in 2024 and 2025
    * Budget per Month: 564,679 ISK (salary category no. 695.020)
    
   *Note*: Should there be challenges in securing a suitable Master's student within the designated timeframe, the 
 allocated funds for this purpose will be redirected to outsource the development of the graphical interface.

2. **Web Hosting**:
   In order to offer a seamless and efficient user experience, we've identified Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our 
   hosting partner of choice. AWS offers a robust and scalable infrastructure, ensuring that our application remains 
   accessible and responsive, even as our user base grows. Here's a simplified breakdown of our proposed AWS setup:
   * Amazon EC2 (t2.micro instance): $102/year
   * Amazon RDS (db.t2.micro instance): $156/year
   * Amazon S3 (moderate storage): $60/year
   * Data Transfer (moderate transfer): $120/year
   * Route 53 (domain + DNS): $15/year
   * Domain registration (ISNIC) and annual renewal is 6,789 ISK per year.
   
   Total for AWS (converted to ISK) and domain: Approximately 50,000 ISK/year
   
3. **License Fees**:
   The project will be open-source, and the license fees will be used to cover the costs of the use of generative AI 
   software such as DALL·E and Midjourney. 
   * A standard plan for Midjourney is $96 a year.
   * DALL·E operates on a *pay-as-you-go* pricing model, ensuring users only pay for the resources they actually 
     utilize.
   * Chat-GPT is $300/year. 
   
   Total for license fees: Approximately 50,000 ISK/year

   
An overhead of 100,000 ISK/year is expected, with any funding left over to use for funding Masters Students.
