    \section{Introduction}

    Textiles, traditionally intertwined with women's work, embody a rich tapestry of skill, precision, and creativity.
    Ada Lovelace, a visionary in computing, recognized the algorithmic nature of the Jacquard loom, thereby linking
    textile arts to computation—a connection that, as \citet{sadieplant} emphasizes, has the potential to inspire women
    to delve into STEM fields, providing a hands-on way to understand engineering and computational concepts.

    HiDef Textiles stands at the intersection of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology, fostering a synergy
    between industrial engineering, computer science, and creative design. This collaborative initiative is not just a
    conduit for innovation but also a platform that champions diversity and inclusion, especially in encouraging
    women's participation in the field. Research works like those by \citet{qiu2013,keune2022} highlight the appeal
    of computational textiles, showcasing their effectiveness in making technology and programming less intimidating
    and more accessible.

    By intertwining artistic expression with engineering precision, HiDef Textiles is democratizing industrial
    processes, making them more accessible and inviting. In doing so, it contributes to the existing knowledge base,
    establishes innovative practices, and encourages diversity within the field, all while fostering a sense of
    community and shared learning.

    This initiative not only enhances the efficiency and sustainability of textile craftsmanship but also opens new
    avenues for learning and participation, ensuring a more inclusive future for the textile industry and beyond.


    \section{Projects}
    At HiDef Textiles, we intertwine the artistry of traditional textiles with the precision of modern technology and
    computational methods, striving for heightened efficiency, accessibility, and sustainability. Our work spans various
    facets of textile craftsmanship, and we highlight three pivotal initiatives below.

    \subsection{Optimization in Embroidery}

    Machine embroidery requires precision, and our initiative is aimed at boosting its
    efficiency. We are streamlining the workflow from design to stitching, employing
    operations research optimization techniques. Our goal is to significantly reduce
    setup and cleanup times, a major bottleneck in the embroidery process.

    In partnership with \citet{inkstitch}, an open-source embroidery design tool, we are
    working to integrate shortest route algorithms to enhance their toolkit. This task
    involves optimizing stitch points for efficiency and aesthetic appeal. Our efforts are
    streamlined to save time in both industrial setups and for hobbyists, ensuring
    precision and pleasing visual outcomes.

    \begin{description}
        \item[Objective:] Optimizing stitching paths used in machine embroidery.
        \item[Milestone 1:] Introduce basic concepts of shortest path problems to students.
        Students implement basic version for hands-on experience.
        \item[Milestone 2:] Add an additional layer of complexity to the problem by introducing an optimization for
        the start/end nodes in the sub-paths.
        \item[Milestone 3:] Develop advanced scenarios for master's projects focusing on processing paths for satin
        stitches, how they should meet and/or cross-over, and how to optimize the path for aesthetic appeal.
    \end{description}

    \subsection{Fabric Utilization in Sewing}

    Sewing requires precise pattern placement and fabric cutting, particularly in garment creation.
    This initiative aims to optimize these aspects using advanced algorithms. We address challenges
    like irregular fabric shapes and matching pattern repeats. Our goal is to minimize fabric waste,
    providing adaptable solutions for various fabric widths and suggesting ideal orientations for pattern pieces.

    We draw on methods from the 2D Free Form Bin Packing and 2D Irregular Cutting Stock Problems
    \citep{bennell2009tutorial, xu2016efficient}, targeting home sewists and small-scale garment
    makers. Our project helps these groups maximize fabric use, conserve resources, and adopt
    sustainable sewing practices. These users often work with non-uniform fabric shapes on a
    small scale, lacking access to advanced tools. Our open-source approach is thus invaluable.

    \begin{description}
        \item[Objective:] Optimize pattern placement and fabric utilization in garment creation by developing
        advanced algorithms to handle irregular fabric shapes and unique materials, to reduce fabric waste.

        \item[Milestone 1:] Begin with fundamental principles of fabric utilization, focusing on the
        optimal arrangement of regular shapes (rectangles) from a rectangular piece of fabric, i.e. cutting stock
        problem.

        \item[Milestone 2:] Transition to scenarios that involve regular shapes being cut from irregular
        pieces of fabric, teaching students how to maximize fabric usage with remnants or animal hides.

        \item[Milestone 3:] Introduce the complexity of cutting irregular shapes from regular fabric
        pieces, emphasizing efficient orientation and placement strategies. A common problem in industrial sewing.

        \item[Milestone 4:] Expand to real-world bespoke garment-making challenges, dealing with irregular
        shapes being cut from irregular fabric pieces.

        \item[Milestone 5:] Broaden the context to a 3D space, applying the same principles to
        3D printing, where students learn to place objects on a printer bed, navigating the added
        dimensions and complexities.
    \end{description}


    \subsection{AI-Enhanced Knitwear Design and Visualization}

    We are pioneering in AI-enhanced knitwear design and visualization, facilitating the adjustment of knitting
    patterns to individual needs, whether it be gauge discrepancies or yarn substitutions. This initiative benefits both
    knitters and designers, providing an easy means to adapt patterns and create versatile designs that accommodate
    varying gauges and yarn types.
    To fuel our innovation, we leverage extensive databases, including Ravelry\footnote{
        Ravelry, founded by \citeauthor{Ravelry} in \citeyear{Ravelry}, provides a comprehensive platform for fiber
        artists to share patterns, discuss techniques, and showcase finished projects. It enables users to browse and
        purchase patterns, track their own projects, and connect with a global community of enthusiasts. The platform
        hosts millions of user-generated patterns, making it an invaluable resource for understanding the knitting
        and crocheting community.
    }, a platform crucial for analyzing current trends, popular designs, and common pattern modifications.
    This deep understanding aids in the development of our generative AI applications, pushing the boundaries of
    pattern design and visualization.

    \begin{description}
        \item[Objective:] Develop generative AI applications for pattern instruction and modification of
        knitwear designs.
        \item[Milestone 1:] Analyze Ravelry dataset (meta-data) for trends and pattern popularity.
        \item[Milestone 2:] Develop generative AI for Fairisle patterns, using images of lopapeysa for training.
        \item[Milestone 3:] Identify and work on public domain patterns for future generative AI applications.
        \item[Milestone 4:] For complex knitwear like lace techniques, solicit participation from knitwear designers
        for pattern instruction sets.
        \item[Milestone 5:] Optimize patterns based on perceived quality, and reproduce using AI.
