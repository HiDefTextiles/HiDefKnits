4.	Coloring arrangement (e.g. fair-isle)

### Project tasks and participants
Helga Ingimundardóttir is the core developer and knitter of all stitches deliverables.
1.	Translating measurements to stitches are based on the users gauge swatch of stockinette stitch.
2.  Textures are denoted with knitting abbreviations standards.
	Library consists of:
	a. 	Ribbing
	b.	Cable knit
	c.	Lace knit
3.  Finishing techniques:
	a.	Cast-on
	b.	Bind-off
	c. 	Decreases/increases
4.	Fair-isle support. For domestic machine-knitting there is a constraint of maximum number of 4 colors to be loaded to a machine.
	This effects color discretization when uploading images to chart color conversion.
